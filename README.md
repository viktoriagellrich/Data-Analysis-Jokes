* How long should a good joke be?
* Are there jokes everyone likes?

## The Underlying Data
Jester is an online joke recommender system developed by Ken Goldberg and the team at UC Berkeley. Users are presented jokes through an HTML client interface and allowed to rate jokes. Once a user rates all jokes in the gauge set, the system recommends new jokes to the user. The dataset contains over 1.7 million continuous ratings (-10.00 to +10.00) of 150 jokes from 59,132 users. The dataset is collected between November 2006 - May 2009.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis includes some NLP techniques.

## Results
Jokes that are funny to everyone just do not exist. Nor jokes that everyone regards as terrible. The second worst rated joke has also been the most controversial one.
Whether a joke is funny or not remains very subjective. So the best you can do is respond to the preferences of your listeners.
A first clue is to tell a story in the joke with more than 600 characters.
